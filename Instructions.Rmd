# Part 1

## Goal: Investigate the the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem

### Set Up
  * Use *rexp(n,lambda)* to get **exponential distribution**
      + The **mean** and **standard deviation** of the **exponential distribution** is *1/lambda*
      + Set *lambda* to **0.2** for all simulations
  * We are looking for the distribution of averages of **40** exponential distributions
      + You will be doing **1000** simulations
      
### Questions
  1. Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.
  2. Show how variable the sample (via variance) is and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.
  3. Show that the distribution is **approximately normal**
      + Focus on the difference between the distribution of a large collection of random exponentials and the distribution of a large collection of averages of 40 exponentials
